Agenda:

2. Format of the paper:
- What should be the desired page length?

- Should I include parts of code in my paper?

3. TODO:
- Try the baselines with different libraries
- Gather more data and sanitize it
- 

4. How should we test the output?
- Is more / less important entity a good way of testing?
- F1
