1. Which programming language to use? - python
2. Am I allowed to use libraries? - yes
3. A machine learning approach to summarize? Hybrid? If hybrid, then form judging criteria?
4. Some libraries that search thorugh a text for Wikipedia articles / annotations. Can look into implementation of this algorithm? USe this library? [A Framework for Benchmarking Entity-Annotation Systems]
5. NLP methods in python https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-Python-code-that-extract-all-phrases-and-part-of-speech-POS-tags-of-a-sentence
6. 

Problem to be broken into two subparts:
1. Parsing
	- Making a class for entities
	- Count frequency, also frequency in consequtive sentences (As that should increase it's importance).
	- Need to find a way to check if it is a Proper / Common Noun / Verb.
	- Have boolean parameters: isInQuotes, isCaps, isTime (week / day / month).
	- Maintain dictionary of words to match input words. Dictionaries for nouns, etc.
	- Handle edge cases of input reading: VU's , New York
	- Reduce similar words into the same entity (differ / differentiate / difference).
	- Check if it is the subject of the word.
	
	- Candidate Key phrases approach: extraction of candidate keyphrases considering punctuations and stop words as the phrase 
		boundary, check paper : A Hybrid Approach to Extract Keyphrases from Medical Documents
2. Saliency
	- Rank words higher if:
		- Quoted.
		- Noun / Verb
		- Bold / Italic
		- Capitalised
		- High frequency
		- time
		- Check the importance of sentence it came from? Should we include sentence importance to check the rank of a word?
		- Computing word importance using TF * IDF = n . log(M/m)
		- Look for adjectives near an entity (significant growth) from edmundson


Action Points:
- Discover more edge cases of input reading.


[ONLY ENGLISH LANGUAGE]
[DO IT IN PYTHON]

Jacopo's Input:
1. Do NLP pre-processing
2. Tokenizaton
3. Translation: find the root of the word (plural to singular)
4. NAme entity recognition: is the task of diving given text into (identify the substing that belongs to an entity)
5. SpaCy: Speech Tagging. Download it, it has named entity recognition.

Find the state of the art for NER (BERT? by google). I need to find the state of the art 


TASKS:

1. What is the beststate of the art in NAmed Entity Recognition and NLP preprocessing

NLP community like to test everything on data sets. NER : BERT, NEURO-NER.
To read about NLP pre-processing, go for Jucosky(Stanford) textbook.

2. Standford open NLP framework / Spacy preprocessing to do. 
3. Learn ML: python, keras (tensor flow, pytorch)


So far those on parsing. Find papers in saliency.

1. Saliency in paragraph? 

- Think of a way to define saliency? Then think of a method? We may decide to do some deep learning (i nthis case we might think of a deep learning). 

- Implement a base line by the end of month.

Develop a method. do not return too many entities. My text is news. Look for news corpus, that is my input.
- Instead of req, page rank (importance)

data sets created for summarization, check your ranking.It's an extrinsic approach. Look for intrinsic measures. Do literature study on methods. As a last resort, we do human evalutaion. We select some candidates and ask them which entities should be there?
