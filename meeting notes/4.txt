Agenda:



1. How to cite?
- Should I stick to one version of citing or can I combine multiple? 
- Is there a preference of one format over other? 
- In some references, the date of the publication is not known, is it fine to proceed without the date? 
- Is it mandatory to mention the page number from the citation?

2. Format of the paper:
- What should be the desired page length?
- Does the numebr of columns matter?
- Should I have all figures and tables at the end of the paper in the appendix?
- Should I include parts of code in my paper?

3. TODO:
- Try the baselines with different libraries
- Gather more data and sanitize it
- 

4. How should we test the output?
- F1
- human eval to grade

5. Baselines
- Frequency Analysis
- LDA + POS + Subject/Object
- Sentence Scoring
- Word Importance
- Summary extraction
- Pagerank : entity centrality, google paper
- Phrase vectors : file:///home/harsh/Downloads/kevin_jacobs.pdf
